          I am Egyptian artist who graduated from the University of Fine Art in
          Alexandria in 2012, I like working with ruined and demolished
          buildings and they appear a lot in my work
        </p>
        <p>
          The notion of ruined buildings exists in all countries, and there are
          different reasons for this, to make money, the result of wars or
          revolutions or just natural causes. After the buildings were
          demolished you can find different natural compositions without human
          intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually humans are the main reason behind the building being
          demolished and they don’t think about the value of this place and the
          memories inside, outside and around this place, they are only thinking
          about money or wars or revenge. Every ruined place around the world
          has a different case and a different story For example Venice has a
          lot of ruined buildings due to natural causes or lack of maintenance
          but without human intervention. However, in Marseille many poor people
          have been evicted from their homes in the centre of the city, in order
          for the government or local councils to rebuild and sell offices or
          apartments and make a lot of money. This is very similar to my home
          town Alexandria where many buildings are demolished by private
          landlords to make a lot of money.
        </p>
        <p>
          They pay no attention to the historic or symbolic value of the
          building; they are only concerned with building sub adequate
          accommodation to sell for a large profit, ignoring completely people’s
          memories attached to each building. When I started this project in
          Alexandria I took photos of the exterior of the ruins because it was
          very difficult and dangerous to go inside. However when I came to
          Marseille I was able to enter inside these buildings where I found
          different abstract compositions and colors all around the sites.
